# Toucan templates
---

The templates are being standardized in preparation for the 1.0.0 release. This document outlines the structure of the template files used during the beta release cycle.

## Top-level templates

There are a few top level templates that most of the themes will include inside the `themes/default/templates` folder:

```sh
html.mustache
redirect.mustache
rss.mustache
sitemap.mustache
```

The HTML template file renders most of the websiteâ€™s HTML content and serves as the main entry point for every HTML page.

The redirect template is used when Toucan needs to redirect one URL to another, utilizing a simple JavaScript-based solution.

The RSS template generates the `rss.xml` file for the site.

The sitemap template generates the `sitemap.xml` file for the website.

## Page templates

The HTML template features a `main` block, that can be overwritten from other templates, every page uses a template file and creates a custom main section to render its contents. 

Here are some standard page template locations:

- Deafult - `pages/default.mustache`.
- Home page - `pages/home.mustache`.
- Not found page - `pages/404.mustache`.


## Partial templates

- Navigation - `partials/navigation.mustache`
- Header - `partials/header.mustache`
- Footer - `partials/footer.mustache`
- Icons - `partials/icons.mustache`

Both partial and page templates may vary per theme; it is common practice to organize them into folders based on [content types](/docs/themes/content-types/).
