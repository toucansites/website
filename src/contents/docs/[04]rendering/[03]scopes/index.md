# Scopes
---

Scopes define the final output context when rendering content in Toucan. The two phase-rendering process is mentioned on the [rendering](/docs/rendering/) page.

Scopes control which front matter properties and relations are included or excluded from the rendered output.

This allows fine-tuning of the content structure, depending on the target use case (e.g. API vs HTML output).

> Note: Scopes are currently experimental.

More detailed documentation and examples will be available in the next beta release.
