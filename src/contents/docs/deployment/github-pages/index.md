---

Toucan-based websites can be hosted for free using GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to set up your site:

1. Create a repository for your website on GitHub.
2. Place all your source files into an src directory within the repository.
3. Run the `toucan generate` command to generate your site.
4. Commit and push the generated files to your repository.
5. Navigate to the repositoryâ€™s __Settings__ > __Pages__ section.
6. In the Pages settings, select the directory containing the generated site files.

Once done, your site should be live on GitHub Pages.
