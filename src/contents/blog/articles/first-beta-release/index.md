Toucan is now ready for [beta](https://github.com/toucansites/toucan/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.1) testing. During this phase, the focus will be on bug fixes and overall quality-of-life improvements.

A significant change from version 1.0.0-alpha.3 is the introduction of custom block directives. More details about this feature can be found in the corresponding [documentation](/docs/themes/block-directives/) section.

Another new feature is the init command, which assists in bootstrapping the creation of a static website. Simply run `toucan init` to get started.

This is a great time to start building your own site with Toucan. The team is eager to see the projects created using our static site generator.

Check out the sample repositories for inspiration and start building your own site or theme with Toucan:

- [Minimal example](https://github.com/toucansites/minimal-example)
- [Swift on Server](https://github.com/swift-on-server/site/)

We hope you find Toucan easy to use, and we greatly value your feedback. üôè
