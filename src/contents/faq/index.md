Frequently Asked Questions about Static Site Generators for complete beginners.


## General questions

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>What is a static site generator?</h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        A Static Site Generator (SSG) is a tool that generates static HTML pages from templates or components, typically using content written in markdown or other markup languages.
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>How does a static site generator differ from a traditional CMS?</h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        Unlike traditional Content Management Systems (CMS) that generate pages dynamically on the server for each request, SSGs generate all the pages at build time. The static HTML can then be served by a simple file server, resulting in faster load times and increased security.

## Setup and installation

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>How do I install a static site generator?</h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        Installation instructions typically vary by SSG, but most can be installed using package managers like npm (Node.js) or gem (Ruby). Detailed instructions are usually provided in the documentation. <!--If you are looking for the Toucan installation instructions, please visit our corresponding [docs](/docs/) section.-->

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>What are the system requirements for running a static site generator?</h3>
    </summary>
    <div>
        Most SSGs require a modern operating system and a working installation of Node.js, Ruby, Python, or another relevant programming environment. <!-- However, since Toucan is distributed as an executable binary, there is no need to set up additional tools on your machine. -->
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        <h3>How do I set up my first static site?</h3>
    </summary>
