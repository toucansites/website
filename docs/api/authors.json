Ensure that Swift and Xcode are installed on your Mac. While it is possible to install Toucan on Linux, using macOS is highly recommended during the alpha release.</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">git clone https://github.com/toucansites/toucan.git\n# install the toucan binary\nmake install\n# verify the installation\nwhich toucan\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"how-does-the-toucan-command-work\">How does the Toucan command work?</h2><p>Every Toucan project operates within the current directory, so when building and running the project using Xcode, you will need to set up a custom working directory.</p><p>You can generate a new website using the <code>generate</code> subcommand, which accepts two arguments: the input directory (default is <code>src</code>) and the output directory (default is <code>docs</code>). Optionally, you can override the base URL if you need to generate the site for local development.</p><p>For example, if you have a site folder with the <code>src</code> inside, you can run the following command to generate the HTML files into a docs folder:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">cd my-site\ntoucan generate ./src ./docs --base-url \"http://localhost:3000/\"\n</code></pre><p>It is also possible to quickly start a local file/web server by running the <code>toucan serve</code> command. This will launch a Hummingbird server, using the <code>docs</code> directory and port <code>3000</code> as defaults, but you can override these settings. For example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">toucan serve ./docs --port 3000\n</code></pre><p>Now, if you open your browser, you should be able to preview the website by entering <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p><p>During development, it‚Äôs useful to rebuild the site automatically when changes occur in the source directory. For this purpose, we‚Äôve implemented a <code>watch</code> command, but currently, it only works on macOS. You can try watching a directory; the command is very similar to the generate subcommand:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">toucan watch ./src ./docs --base-url 'http://localhost:3000/' \n</code></pre><p>That‚Äôs all about the toucan command. Now, let‚Äôs focus on building a simple website.</p><h2 id=\"getting-started-with-toucan-based-websites\">Getting started with Toucan-based websites</h2><p>The first thing you need is a source folder where you can store all the themes, assets, and content for your website.</p><p>Feel free to grab one of our themes to get started. We also have a minimal starter project available under the <a href=\"https://github.com/toucansites\" target=\"_blank\">toucansites</a> GitHub organization.</p><p>Make sure to place the theme in the <code>themes/default</code> folder. Alternatively, you can set the <code>theme.use</code> value in the site‚Äôs configuration YAML to use a custom folder.</p><p>Now, you need a proper configuration for your site. Don‚Äôt worry, it can be as simple as this example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">site:\n    baseUrl: \"http://localhost:3000/\"\n    title: \"Minimal example\"\n    description: \"This is a minimal Toucan example\"\n</code></pre><p>Next, create a content folder and add some Markdown documents.</p><p>The <code>index.md</code> will serve as the homepage for your website. Feel free to modify this file as needed.</p><pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">---\ntitle: \"Home title\"\ndescription: \"Home description\"\n---\n\nWelcome to the home page.\n</code></pre><p>The section between the <code>---</code> characters is called the front matter, where you can customize the properties of your page.</p><p>The homepage and 404 page are a bit different. The homepage has no slug, and the 404 page will always be named <code>404.html</code> when the final content is generated.</p><p>Every page will use a slug based on the folder structure you create. For example, if you need a subpage called <code>about</code>, simply create a folder named about and place an <code>index.md</code> file inside it.</p><p>If you want to omit a folder from the hierarchy, just add a <code>noindex.yml</code> file to that directory. For example, consider the following structure:</p><pre><code class=\"language-sh\">.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 404\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authors\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ alan-turing\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬†  ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ noindex.yml\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬†  ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ turings-legacy-in-modern-computing\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬†  ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tags\n‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ technology\n‚îÇ¬†¬†         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-page\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md\n</code></pre><p>The following pages will be available:</p><ul><li><code>/</code></li><li><code>404</code></li><li><code>blog</code></li><li><code>blog/authors/alan-turing</code></li><li><code>blog/posts/turings-legacy-in-modern-computing</code></li><li><code>blog/tags/technology</code></li><li><code>my-page</code></li></ul><p>Notice the <code>noindex.yml</code>file in the 2024 folder, which is omitted from the slug.</p><p>Now that you understand the basics, feel free to create your own structure and experiment with Toucan. You can find working examples by checking the source code of <a href=\"https://github.com/toucansites/website\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> website or the <a href=\"https://github.com/theswiftdev/blog\" target=\"_blank\">theswiftdev.com</a> site, both available on GitHub.</p><p>That‚Äôs all you need to know to get started with Toucan. üòä</p>",
