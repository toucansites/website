# Scopes
---

Scopes control the shape of the context object used during [rendering](/docs/rendering/). They determine which front matter properties and content relations are included in the final output.

This mechanism gives you fine-grained control over the structure of the rendered context, allowing you to tailor output for different targets â€” such as a minimal context for JSON APIs or a rich context for full HTML pages.

> Scopes are currently experimental and subject to change. More detailed documentation and usage examples will be provided later on.
