# Creating a Repository for Your Site

To host a Toucan-generated website on GitHub Pages, begin by creating a new repository or selecting an existing one. Follow the steps below to ensure your repository is configured correctly.

> GitHub requires public visibility for Pages sites hosted under Free or Free for Organizations plans.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the upper-right corner of any GitHub page. Click the `+` icon, then select **New repository**.

3. Enter a repository name:
   - For personal or organization-wide sites, the repository can be named `username.github.io` or `orgname.github.io`
   - Ensure the name is entirely lowercase

4. Set the repository visibility to **Public**. Refer to [About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility) for details.

5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

6. Click **Create repository** to complete setup.

If you are working within an existing repository, proceed directly to the [Deploying with GitHub Pages](/docs/github-pages/deploying-with-github-pages) guide.
